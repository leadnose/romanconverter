WHAT

A simple program to convert roman numerals to their decimal
equivalents. May also convert strings that aren't sensible roman
numerals, such as XIIIII, which would be written as XV normally. Can
also be used as a library.

COMPILATION

If needed, adjust the CLASSPATH variable in the Makefile so that javac
and java can find your junit-libraries.

To compile, just run

$ make

To run the tests, run

$ make test

USAGE

After compilation, you can run the program from the command line just
like any other normal Java program.

With 1 argument, the argument is converted from roman to decimal and
printed to standard output. With 0 arguments, roman numerals are read
from standard input one per line, and converted and printed to
standard output.
