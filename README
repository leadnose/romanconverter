A simple program to convert roman numerals to their decimal
equivalents. May also convert strings that aren't sensible roman
numerals, such as XIIIII, which would be written as XV normally. Can
also be used as a library.

With 1 argument, the argument is converted from roman to decimal and
printed to standard output. With 0 arguments, roman numerals are read
from standard input one per line, and converted and printed to
standard output.
